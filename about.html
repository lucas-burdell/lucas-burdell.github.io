        <p>My name is Lucas Burdell. As programming is my passion, it was only a matter of time before I started toying with web development. After spending a week learning Ruby on Rails and reading the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book/">Rails Tutorial book by Michael Hartl</a>, I decided to learn something else. I remembered learning from my friend <a href="https://drewhans555.github.io/">Drew Hans</a> that GitHub supports building custom website pages, and finally got around looking into it today, May 14th 2017. This site is the product of that spur of curiosity.

        GithubPages, the technology that this site runs on, uses the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll static site generator</a>, which gives some of the same power that Ruby on Rails affords such as uniform layouts and page templating. For example, I can create what Jekyll calls "posts" which function like blog posts. These posts are HTML documents that only contain the post content; the navbar and footer are inserted by Jekyll according to a template HTML file I created. The post content is inserted inside the template's code at a specified point in the template. This is all done using the <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid template language</a>.
        <p>
        Another technology I used is the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap Framework by Twitter</a> which is used to create the adaptive CSS layout. Bootstrap is designed to be "mobile first" meaning it is designed to fit mobile device screens, and then scale up to Desktop-sized screens. This is why the site still looks decent on a mobile phone.
