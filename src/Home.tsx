        Hey, I'm Lucas Burdell! Writer, gamer, tech enthusiast, software
        developer and 3D printer hobbyist. Science and technology are my main
        passions, and passion is the fuel that drives me to tinker and build. My day
        job is as a software developer, which gives me an outlet for my
        urge for passion-fueled creation and also keeps the lights on!
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        I've been a software developer for <b><CountupClock date={hiredDate} /></b>.
        <br />
        However, I've always been interested in computer programming. I wrote my first program somewhere in 2009.
